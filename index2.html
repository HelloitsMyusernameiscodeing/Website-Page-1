 <h1>Books</h1>  
 <p>As an architect I have made many projects and I have read many books too which have given me a lot of perspectives
towards new ways of architecture. Now there are many books to read and not to read . Here I will clear all of your doubts
on books and will recommend too 
<h1>the fountainhead</h1>
<p>This a classic book I have read published in 1943 by a russian american author Ayn Rand</p>
<p>Howard Roark, a brilliant young architect, is expelled from his architecture school for refusing to follow 
the schools outdated traditions. He goes to New York to work for Henry Cameron, a disgraced architect whom Roark admires. 
Roark’s schoolmate, Peter Keating, moves to New York and goes to work for the prestigious architectural firm Francon & Heyer, 
 run by the famous Guy Francon. Roark and Cameron create beautiful work, but their projects rarely receive recognition, whereas
Keating’s ability to flatter and please brings him almost instant success. In just a few years, he becomes a partner at the 
firm after he causes Francon’s previous partner to have a stroke. Henry Cameron retires, financially ruined, and Roark opens
his own small office. His unwillingness to compromise his designs in order to satisfy clients eventually forces him to close
down the office and take a job at a granite quarry in Connecticut. In Connecticut, Roark feels an immediate, passionate 
attraction to Dominique Francon.</p>

 <h2>tips on becoming  a better architect </h2>
<p>Going to different places and observing:This gives you a view of architecture is different in places of the world
I started with a indian village whre i observed their problems , art and even interacted with a vilager to see what they do 
. I made a lot of observations about villages and rural life in india . I also studied that masterplan and the design of the village
to know more . 
<h2>The city</h2>
In the city yes we all know lot buildings , shops , malls parks etc . I was travelling through delhi and gurgaon whil travelling saw how congested it
was . This is a simple mistake of having not good architecture why because The lanes were really small also the buildings were really
big which simply shows how unsymterical it is .
